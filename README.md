# RomiCPPTimedRobotExample
This is a sample project for running a basic timed robot project for WPILib.

All of the magic happens in [Robot.cpp](src/main/cpp/Robot.cpp). 
The project could be entirely self-contained there, however, since the template used a header file, we decided to utilize it as well.

You can find it in the [include] (src/main/include/Robot.h) folder. You can add additional imports and constructors there.
